# INSTALLATION PROCESS

I built a solution based on Grunt and npm that allow to show some of my skills
at the same time that simplify a bit the implementation processs. This solution is
based in Bootstrap Sass, VanillaJS and Handlebars in order to be able to test it,
you need to follow the next steps:

1. Put the project in a XAMPP, LAMPP environment.
2. Execute `npm install` to load the packages required
3. Run the command `grunt build` to create the dist folder where we will run the site
4. `Open the index.html` in the dist folder.
